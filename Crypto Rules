1. Restrict transactions to 50% of an account's savings per day
   --> If a transaction is less than $50,000 in value, this percentage limit is increased to 70%
   --> If a transaction is less than $25,000 in value, this percentage limit is increased to 90%
   --> If a transaction is less than $10,000 in value, this percentage limit is increased to 100%
2. A single account can only transact up to $100,000 worth of GRM per hour.
   --> Once the account has more than $500,000 worth of GRM, this limit is increased to 20% of total savings per hour
3. When an account transacts an amount of GRM exceeding $10,000 in value, a certain amount of currency will be burned from their transaction equal to 5%
   of the amount which that currency exceeds $10,000 dollars
   --> 50% of the burned currency is randomly distrubuted
   Ex: if someone transacts $30,000; 30,000-10,000 = 20,000; 5% of 20,000 = 1,000; --> $1000 
   dollars worth of GRM are burned and 50% of $1000 = $500 of GRM are randomly distributed).
